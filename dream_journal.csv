I realize that I left my purse at the seat, so I ""conjure"" it up. I ask the lady at the counter what my prize is. She shows me the picture on the coupon. It's a grill, lots of food. I ask her to repeat; she speaks but I can't understand the words. It's something about a scholarship to a college. I look up to see my Aunt Esther and Dora. I'm delighted to see them and I say, ""Oh, How nice to see you. It's been a long time."" We chat. Then I go outside. There is lots of water. I'm standing on a dock. I see 2 lines of relatives. Uncle Lionel has a white handkerchief over his face (lower half). He has an allergy. Some of my relatives get into a boat and drive away, across a wooden boundary between 2 bodies of water. Uncle Lionel is shocked. ""I'd never be such a fool as to do that."" Then my father gets into a small row boat and I get in. He slowly and carefully goes over the wooden boundary. The motor gets caught. My father says ""Uh-oh."" I say, ""Don't tell me uh-oh, when we're in deep water."" We then get over the thing. Then I'm in a canal. An Indian guide is behind me paddling. He is reciting the legends of our people. I feel like I'm going home.",sad,"{'happy': np.float64(0.01815655548722161), 'neutral': np.float64(0.009398195809920157), 'nightmare': np.float64(0.006459465051438775), 'sad': np.float64(0.9659857836514195)}",,False

2025-08-29,Scary,"Later dream. I found a small monkey, miniature, really. He was given to me. He was in a bird cage, gold. There was glass so it was also like a fishbowl. It was dying because there was no air, food, or water. I opened a door in the glass to let in air. I could hear it hissing in and I could feel the flow of air into the cage. It was cold and ""mean."" I then got his food and water containers. I ""thought"" talked to it soothingly. ""Poor little thing. I'll bet you think I'm taking this away from you to hurt you, but see, I'm filling the cup and it's fresh. Now, here's the water. That's the most important, isn't it?"" The water cup then partially collapsed and the water spilled onto the food, but it was still O.K., just a little messy. Then I got nervous. I watched as the monkey changed. It was supposed to be cute and sit on my shoulder and chitter and be furry and hug me. I had held the door partially open with my keys (on a little sandal shoe), but the monkey was tiny, like a spider with a long tail. Then it was a small snake. I got really scared. The snake was growing and it was going to eat me, or kill me. It grew and I fled the room. I was on a road/freeway. There were many cars. I was in one. We were all fleeing the snake. It was huge now. The freeway was choked with cars. There was road construction and dust was thick in the air. I heard the screams of the others being killed by the snake. I felt fear and a certainty that this was it. No escape. The snake would get me. I looked to my left. The snake was on a moving train, devouring it and the people on it. I veered to the right and got out of the car, I tried to make myself very small and tried to burrow into the ground. I was burying myself alive to escape the notice of the snake. I felt doomed. It would find me.",nightmare,"{'happy': 0.01929405555124902, 'neutral': 0.028201886074956314, 'nightmare': 0.9404905349292255, 'sad': 0.012013523444569095}",,False
